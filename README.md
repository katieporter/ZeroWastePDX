### Welcome

This website is a home for crowdsourced resources to help the Portland community live a lower waste lifestyle. These resources are completely generated by the Portland community so its possible you may come across something that isn't quite right- maybe an incorrect price or an item that is no longer available. Please help out the community and submit a correction! 

### Portland Bulk Inventory

This is a community generated inventory of the bulk bins of Portand. It is by no means exhaustive. Help us out by adding new items you see using the form below. You can browse through each store or use the search function to find exactly the item you are looking for.
